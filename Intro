📈 AI Meets Markets: A Deep Learning Approach to Stock Forecasting, Risk Mitigation & Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains the implementation and research behind a comprehensive deep learning-based framework designed for stock market prediction. The approach integrates LSTM models, financial risk evaluation, and sentiment analysis to generate intelligent investment recommendations.

📌 Project Highlights
Stock Forecasting using LSTM
A multi-layer LSTM model is trained on over 10 years (2010–2024) of historical data for Reliance, Infosys, and TCS. The model achieves R² scores ranging from 0.85 to 0.92, indicating strong prediction accuracy.

Risk Management Module
Calculates company-specific risk scores using financial indicators like Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Operating Margin, Beta, and ESG scores, producing actionable financial risk assessments.

Sentiment Analysis Engine
Extracts real-time sentiment from news headlines and Twitter feeds using a deep LSTM-based classifier. This enhances price prediction with market perception data.

Unified Investment Recommendation System
Combines outputs from all three models into a DNN-based decision engine to issue final stock advice: Buy, Hold, or Sell.

📊 Technologies Used
Python 3.7+, TensorFlow 2.x, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, yfinance, TextBlob, Tweepy

🧠 Target Audience
Researchers, data scientists, investors, and finance-tech enthusiasts interested in applying AI to financial markets.
